IDEAS

-Make a interface to filter some baseitem types
24 (trinkets) 
49 (potion) 
65 (keys) 
75 (scrolls)
102 (blank scroll)
77 (gems)
66 (bag)
do all baseitem and add checkall, uncheck all so we can export easly only wanted baseitems

-Repair DReduction

-Add in item cost and level and t10 and t11 status
->I dont know yet how to get the item cost, for the tier status it's ok

-several bic files -> 1 csv file 

-export to xls insteand of csv, so we can use color sorts etc


-would be nice if the columns were grouped together by their type. like abilies near to each other
-> yes there is a sort system that I have to improved since i added the expand feature

-level
-> I think I can calculate it from the codex codex code I made

-one problem is that items that i wear are in the list
-> I can make a checkbox for that
